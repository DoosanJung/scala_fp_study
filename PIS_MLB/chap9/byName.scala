/*
the expression inside the parentheses in boolAssert(5 > 3) is evaluated be- fore the call to 
boolAssert. The expression 5 > 3 yields true, which is passed to boolAssert.

By contrast, because the type of byNameAssertâ€™s predicate parameter is => Boolean, the expression 
inside the parentheses in byNameAssert(5 > 3) is not evaluated before the call to byNameAssert.

e.g.
scala> boolAssert(x / 0 == 0)
java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero

scala> byNameAssert(x / 0 == 0)
no exception!!
